2: Exploratory Data Analysis
Understanding the business through data

# Background Information
The BCG project team thinks that building a churn model to understand whether price sensitivity is the largest driver of churn has potential. The client has sent over some data and the AD wants you to perform some exploratory data analysis.

The data that was sent over includes:

	Historical customer data: Customer data such as usage, sign up date, forecasted usage etc
	Historical pricing data: variable and fixed pricing data etc
	Churn indicator: whether each customer has churned or not

Please submit analysis in a code script, notebook, or PDF format. 

Please note, there are multiple ways to approach the task and that the sample answer is just one way to do it.

# Task Brief
Sub-Task 1:

Perform some exploratory data analysis. Look into the data types, data statistics, specific parameters, and variable distributions. This first subtask is for you to gain a holistic understanding of the dataset. You should spend around 1 hour on this.

Sub-Task 2:

Verify the hypothesis of price sensitivity being to some extent correlated with churn. It is up to you to define price sensitivity and calculate it. You should spend around 30 minutes on this.

Sub-Task 3:

Prepare a half-page summary or slide of key findings and add some suggestions for data augmentation – which other sources of data should the client provide you with and which open source datasets might be useful? You should spend 10-15 minutes on this.

For your final deliverable, please submit your analysis (in the form of a jupyter notebook, code script or PDF) as well as your half-page summary document.

Note: Use the 2 datasets within the additional resources for this task and if you’re unsure on where to start with visualizing data, use the accompanying links. Be sure to also use the data description document to understand what the columns represent. The task description document outlines the higher-level motivation of the project. Finally, use the eda_starter.ipynb file to get started with some helper functions and methods.

If you are stuck: Think about ways you can define price sensitivity. Make sure to think of all possible ways and investigate them.
